 What is JSX?
  JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, which can then be
  compiled into regular JavaScript code.

 Superpowers of JSX?
  
  READABILITY
  
  Declarative syntax: JSX provides a declarative syntax for defining the structure and appearance of UI components. You can write code that looks like HTML, 
  but with the full power of JavaScript behind it. This makes it easier to reason about your code and understand how your UI components are structured.
  
  Type safety: JSX is statically typed, which means that you can catch errors at compile time instead of runtime. This makes it easier to catch bugs and
  prevent them from happening in production. You can also use tools like TypeScript to add even more type safety to your JSX code.

 Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can i use there?
  
  The type attribute in the <script> tag specifies the MIME type of the script being loaded. The MIME type is a way of identifying the type of content being 
  served by the server, and it tells the browser how to interpret the contents of the script.

  Here are some common options for the type attribute in the <script> tag:

 // text/javascript: This is the default value for the type attribute if it's not specified. It tells the browser that the contents of the script are JavaScript code.

 // text/typescript: This value specifies that the contents of the script are TypeScript code, which is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.

 // application/javascript: This value is similar to text/javascript and tells the browser that the contents of the script are JavaScript code. However, it's more 
  specific about the MIME type of the content.

 // application/x-javascript: This value is similar to text/javascript and application/javascript, but it's an older MIME type that's no longer recommended for use.

 // module: This value specifies that the script is an ES6 module, which allows you to use features like import and export to organize your code.

  When using a modern web framework like React, you may see the type attribute set to "text/babel" or "text/jsx". This is because these frameworks often use 
  transpilers to convert JSX syntax (which is not valid JavaScript) into regular JavaScript that can be interpreted by the browser. However, it's generally not recommended to use a transpiler in production code, so it's best to use a production build of the framework that generates standard JavaScript code.

 {TitleComponent} VS {<TitleComponent/>} VS {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
 answer => In JSX (JavaScript XML), which is a syntax extension used by frameworks such as React, there are three ways to render a component:
 
   Using curly braces: {TitleComponent} - this is used to render the component as a variable or a reference. This syntax is typically 
      used when the component is passed as a prop to another component or when it is conditionally rendered based on some logic.
 
   Self-closing syntax: <TitleComponent/> - this is used to render a component as a self-contained element, with no children. 
      This syntax is commonly used for components like buttons, icons, or other UI elements that don't need any children.
 
   Opening and closing tags: <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> - this syntax is used to render a component with children, i.e.,
         nested elements that are contained within the component. This syntax is commonly used for components like containers, headers,
            or other elements that wrap other elements.
 
   All three syntaxes ultimately render the same component, but the choice of syntax depends on the context and the 
  specific use case. In general, it's good practice to be consistent with the chosen syntax within a codebase to ensure 
  readability and maintainability.
  
  
how jsx prevents XSS 

JSX itself does not prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, but it does provide a mechanism for escaping potentially dangerous characters that can be used in conjunction with other security practices to prevent XSS.

When JSX code is transpiled into regular JavaScript, any text nodes within JSX expressions are automatically escaped using a mechanism known as "HTML entity encoding." This means that special characters (such as <, >, ", ', and &) are replaced with their corresponding HTML entities (such as &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &apos;, and &amp;). This encoding prevents the browser from interpreting the characters as HTML or JavaScript code, and instead treats them as plain text.

For example, consider the following JSX expression:

css
Copy code
<p>Hello, {name}!</p>
If the name variable contains the string <script>alert('XSS')</script>, the resulting HTML would be:

php
Copy code
<p>Hello, &lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;!</p>
The encoded characters prevent the browser from executing the script, and instead display the text as plain text.

While JSX's automatic encoding can help prevent some types of XSS attacks, it is not a complete solution on its own. To fully prevent XSS, web developers should also follow other security best practices, such as validating and sanitizing user input, using a Content Security Policy (CSP), and using HTTPOnly cookies.
