    >What is prop drilling?
    >>>>>
        Prop drilling is a term used in software development that refers to the practice of passing data through multiple layers of components in order to get it to the component where it is needed. This can create a chain of dependencies that can make code difficult to manage and maintain.

        For example, consider a React application where data is fetched in a top-level component and then passed down through multiple levels of nested components until it reaches the component where it is needed. This can result in a lot of extra code and complexity, as well as potential performance issues.

        To avoid prop drilling, developers can use state management libraries like Redux or context APIs in React, which allow data to be stored in a central location and accessed by any component that needs it, without the need for props to be passed down through multiple levels. This can make code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

    >>>>>
        Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and itâ€™s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.
