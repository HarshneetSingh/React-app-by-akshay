    >>>>>
      In a React class component, the constructor() method is used to initialize the component's state and to bind 
      methods to the component instance. When defining a constructor in a subclass (i.e., a component that extends 
      React.Component), it is necessary to call the super() method before accessing this.

      The super() method refers to the constructor of the parent class (React.Component), and calling it is necessary 
      to make sure that the component is initialized properly. In particular, it ensures that the this keyword is correctly 
      bound to the component instance, so that the component's state and other instance variables can be accessed and modified.

      The super(props) call also passes the props object to the parent constructor, so that the component can access
      its initial props via this.props. This is particularly useful when you want to set the initial state of the 
      component based on its props, as you can access the props inside the constructor after calling super(props).
