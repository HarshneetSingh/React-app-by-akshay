● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

Answer - Parcel and Webpack are the open-source bundlers , it is a tool that takes your web application's source code and turns it into a deployable package that can 
          be run in a web browser.It can be used to bundle JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other types of assets that make up a web application. parcel is a web 
          application bundler.Parcel is designed to be easy to use, it helps to make you web application run faster . It can perform tasks such as code-splitting, 
          asset optimization, and dependency management
          
          NEED OF PARCEL / WEBPACK ..
          
          Bundling: parcel and webpack bundles the required dependencies for the project into a single package that can be deployed and run on the server.
                    it increases the performance of the app as bundling the files , less network calls made and it make it run faster .
                    
          Code splitting: Both tools can automatically split your application's code into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help improve 
                          performance by allowing you to only load the code that is needed for a particular page or feature, rather than loading 
                          the entire application at once.
                          
          Asset optimization: Both tools can automatically optimize your application's assets, such as minifying JavaScript and CSS, to help improve performance.
          
          Dependency management: Both tools can automatically manage the dependencies of your application, making it easier to keep track of which
                                  packages your application depends on and ensuring that the correct versions are used.
                                  
                                  
                                  
           Overall, tools like Parcel and Webpack can help make the process of building and deploying web applications more efficient and streamlined.
           
           
● - What is `.parcel-cache`?

Answer - The .parcel-cache directory is used by the Parcel bundler to store intermediate files that are generated as it processes your application. These files
          are used to improve the performance of the bundler by allowing it to reuse previously generated files rather than regenerating them each time you build 
          your application.
          
● - What is `npx` ?
Answer - Node Package Execute,npx is a command-line tool that is included with npm, the package manager for JavaScript.It allows you to run Node.js packages and commands from the 
          command line You can also use npx to run scripts defined in the "scripts" field of your package.json file. For example, if you have a script called
          "start"n run defined in your package.json file, you ca it with the following command
          
          in brief,Why is NPX used?
            The command npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager, and npx is used to execute JavaScript packages downloaded this way.
           It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.
